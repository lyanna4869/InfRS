"""
This file registers pre-defined datasets at hard-coded paths, and their metadata.

We hard-code metadata for common datasets. This will enable:
1. Consistency check when loading the datasets
2. Use models on these standard datasets directly and run demos,
   without having to download the dataset annotations

We hard-code some paths to the dataset that's assumed to
exist in "./datasets/".

Users SHOULD NOT use this file to create new dataset / metadata for new dataset.
To add new dataset, refer to the tutorial "docs/DATASETS.md".
